# Data-Structures-Assignments-CS300

This repistory contains all the assignments that I have written for the course CS 300 Data Structures.

The summaries of the assignments can be seen below:

## Knight to the Rescue

In this homework, first, I implemented a program that will generate a chessboard of size NxN, where N represents the columns and rows. Then, implemented a function that will place a certain number of pawns on the board based on given conditions. Finally, implemented another function to place a knight and a king on the chessboard and check if the knight can rescue the king without touching any of the previously placed pawns.
To do this homework, I was required to implement a Stack using a LinkedList data structure. The stack class MUST be template-based. 

## Notebook

In this homework, I implemented two “Notebooks” by using the AVL Search Tree and the Binary Search Tree (BST). Additionally, displayed the speed of some of the operations on these tree data structures that are used for the implementation. Each “Notebook” has a nested tree structure.
Although each Notebook tree will have a separate implementation, they will store the same data and will perform the same operations. Basically, the only difference between the Notebooks will be the data structures that are going to be used for the implementation. Each Notebook will contain multiple sections and each section will have multiple items which will store the information inside.

## Personalized Recommendation System for TV Show Streaming Platforms

In this homework we, as a software developer for an online TV show streaming platform, we ask you to 
develop a tool which will help us to improve our personalized recommendation system. We will provide 
you the viewing history of our customers as an input file and your tool needs to extract all the preference 
relations between the TV shows. For this purpose, you are required to use a templated hash table with 
separate chaining.

## Sorting and Searching

In this homework, I have given an unsorted PhoneBook and asked to sort it in alphabetical order. I must compare the given 4 Sorting algorithms and conclude which one is faster. Also, since fundamental usage of a PhoneBook is search for some names, you are expected to implement 2 search algorithms to compare.
The sorting algorithms you compared are:
●	Insertion Sort
●	Quick Sort   	(pivot=median) (use Insertion Sort when size < 10)
●	Merge Sort	(in place; without using auxiliary memory storage)
●	Heap Sort

The searching algorithms you will compare are:
●	Sequential Search
●	Binary Search
